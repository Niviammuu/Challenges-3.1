Implement  a function called shot students that takes a list of students object as input and shorts each   list based   their CGPA in descending order.each students object has  of following  attributes :name(string)and CGPA (float).test tha function with different input list of students.ï¿¼Not
Certainly! Here's a Python function called `sort_students` that takes a list of student objects and sorts them based on their CGPA in descending order:

```python
def sort_students(students):
    # Sort the students list based on CGPA in descending order
    sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['CGPA'], reverse=True)
    return sorted_students

# Example usage:
students_list = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'CGPA': 3.8},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'CGPA': 3.5},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'CGPA': 3.9},
    # Add more student objects as needed
]

sorted_students = sort_students(students_list)
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"Name: {student['name']}, CGPA: {student['CGPA']}")
```

You can call the `sort_students` function with different lists of student objects, and it will return the sorted list based on CGPA in descending order.
Make sure to adjust the `students_list` with your own data as needed.
